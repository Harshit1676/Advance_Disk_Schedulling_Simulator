Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator
A C-based OS Project implementing FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN
📌 About the Project

This project simulates how various disk scheduling algorithms operate within an Operating System.
It supports:

FCFS
SSTF
SCAN
C-SCAN

The program:

Accepts custom disk request sequences
Visualizes disk head movement
Calculates total head movement, average seek time & throughput

📌 Features

User-defined disk size
User-defined request list
Selectable SCAN/C-SCAN direction
Text output visualization
Performance comparison between all algorithms
